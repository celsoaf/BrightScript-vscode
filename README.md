# brightscript README

To try to mitigate the difficulties in developing for Roku and for a personal project outside of Sky I've developed a Roku Brightscript Debugger. The objective was to have something integrated in an IDE where a developer could connect remotely to a Roku box and would be able not only to have real-time debugging but also control the box and deploy code changes immediatly.
BrightScript Debugger is Visual Studio Code extension to support BrightScript Development. This is a fully integrated tool for application development thereby simplifying the development process, that includes debugging, syntax validation, code compilation, intellisense and graphical debug interaction.
